# Licensing and Contributor License Agreement

This document explains the licensing model for proximum and the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) requirements.

## Dual Licensing Model

proximum uses a **dual licensing** model:

1. **Open Source License**: Apache License 2.0 - always available, free to use
2. **Commercial License**: Available for organizations that prefer commercial terms

### Why Dual Licensing?

Dual licensing allows us to:

- Keep the project open source and free forever
- Fund ongoing development through commercial licenses
- Offer commercial terms for organizations that need them (indemnification, support, etc.)

### Our Commitment

- The project will **always** remain available under an OSI-approved open source license
- Commercial licensing is **in addition to**, not instead of, the open source license
- Both versions receive the same contributions - no "open core" or feature gating

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All commits must include a `Signed-off-by` line:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Use `git commit -s` to automatically add this line.

The DCO certifies that you have the right to submit the contribution. The full text is available at [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org):

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

First-time contributors must sign our CLA. This is handled automatically by the CLA Assistant bot when you open a pull request.

### What the CLA Grants

The CLA grants replikativ the right to:

- Distribute your contributions under Apache-2.0 (the project's open source license)
- Include your contributions in commercially licensed distributions

### What You Keep

- You retain copyright to your contributions
- You can use your own contributions in other projects
- Your contributions remain open source under Apache-2.0

### CLA Text

The full CLA text is available in the repository:

- [Individual CLA](./cla-individual.md)
- [Corporate CLA](./cla-corporate.md) (for contributions made on behalf of an employer)

## Workflow

1. **Fork and branch**: Create a feature branch
2. **Sign commits**: Use `git commit -s` for every commit
3. **Open PR**: Submit a pull request
4. **Sign CLA**: First-time contributors will be prompted by the CLA Assistant bot
5. **Review**: Maintainers review your changes
6. **Merge**: Once approved, your contribution is merged
